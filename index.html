            <p>Lifecycle of Shrimp</p>
<p>
Shrimp don't live very long lives. One to six years is the lifespan of most shrimp. Ghost Shrimp live on the lower end of that range, only up to one year, while Caridean Shrimp can live up to six years. As such, shrimp develop quite quickly, going through several larval stages over just a couple of weeks before they become tiny versions of adult shrimp. This causes the shrimp to consistently molt their skin as they continue to grow. They won't become full-fledged adult shrimps (and thus be available for consumption) until seven to eight months from the time they hatch.

And while they may not have a long life, it doesn't make their lives any less important here on the planet. In fact, shrimp play an invaluable role in helping keep our oceans, seas, and streams clean. </p>
